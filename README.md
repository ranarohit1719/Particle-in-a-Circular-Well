# Particle-in-a-Circular-Well
This is not the same problem as the particle ON a circle.
Here, we utilize a combination of sin and cosine functions to approximate the analytic forms of the solutions to the particle in a circular well problem. The analytic forms utilize Bessel functions of the first kind. At the moment, this code is specific to the ground-state only.

In the code, the user inputs the radius of the circle. As it stands, the code utilizes a step-size of 1,000,000.
